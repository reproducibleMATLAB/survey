# MATLAB Reproducibility Survey

This repo contains data and code relating to a survey of research users of MATLAB.

The survey questions as they were presented are contained in [`survey.md`](survey.md).

The data here is anonymised.

To re-run the analysis, in MATLAB, load the project file `Survey.prj` and open the livescript `analysis.mlx`. Running the livescript should reproduce the results.
