# MATLAB User Survey - Reproducibility

**Participant Information** 

This survey concerns concepts in software reproducibility among academic research users of the MATLAB programming language. We will collect data on the current state of understanding of concepts and tools for reproducible software development among researchers who use MATLAB, as well as the demand for training in these concepts.

The information gathered in this survey will be used to help inform the development of guidance and training materials on reproducible research code & software developed in MATLAB.

This research is being undertaken by Dr David Wilby of The University of Sheffield Research Software Engineering Team as part of a Software Sustainability Institute fellowship.

**Prize Draw**: Survey respondents who supply their email address at the end of the survey will be entered into a draw to win a £50 love2shop voucher. Unfortunately, this voucher can only be spent at a range of UK shops.

**All questions are optional.**

**Please do not include any personally identifiable information, with the exception of your email address at the end of the survey if you would like to be entered into the prize draw. Note that no personal information is collected automatically.**

**Consent**: By taking part in this survey you consent to the collection of your response data. Email addresses will only be collected if explicitly supplied for entrance to the prize draw and will be stored securely until the end of 2022 at the latest when the survey concludes. No other personal data will be collected. You are not obliged to complete the entire survey, partially completed surveys will still be used.

**Ethics**: This survey has been approved by the University of Sheffield's research ethics approval process and complies with its ethics policy.
